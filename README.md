Machine Learning Capstone Project- Credit Card Fraud Detection


üîç** Project Steps**

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* Analyzed distributions of categorical and numerical features.
* Visualized transaction patterns and identified trends in fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent cases.

**2. Data Preprocessing**
* Handled missing values using imputation techniques.

Detected and treated outliers and skewed distributions using statistical methods.

**3. Feature Engineering**
* Encoded categorical features using one-hot and label encoding.

Created new features to improve model performance.

**4. Feature Selection**
* Selected important features contributing to fraud prediction.

**Removed irrelevant and redundant features.

**5. Train-Test Split**
* Split dataset into training and testing sets with stratification to preserve class distribution.

**6. Feature Scaling**
* Applied Min-Max scaling and Z-score normalization to numerical features.

**7. Model Building & Evaluation**
* Evaluated multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM.
* Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
* Selected the best-performing model for deployment.

üìà Outcomes
* Developed an accurate and interpretable model for real-time fraud detection.
* Improved fraud detection capabilities while minimizing false alarms.

üîß Tools & Libraries
* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn
* Jupyter/Google Colab
